# Hey, I'm Het! 😎

### Aka braindead-fr

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m the guy who dabbles in web development while pretending I have everything under control. Fueled by coffee and the occasional burst of productivity.

## About Me

- 🧠 Brain is mostly dead, but I make it work.
- 💻 Web Developer – turning caffeine into code.
- ☕ Caffeine enthusiast and part-time procrastinator.

## Fun Facts

- My code runs… sometimes.
- I believe semicolons are optional (fight me).
- My debugging strategy: "What if I just... tried turning it off and on again?"
- Debugging philosophy: "If it ain't broke, it soon will be."

## Hobbies

- 🕹️ Gaming – because why live one life when you can live many?
- ☕ Coffee – my fuel, my love, my life.
- 🤖 Coding – making computers do things they don't want to do.

Feel free to explore my repos and witness the chaos unfold. If you stumble upon something that doesn't make you question my sanity, consider starring it – it boosts my ego and keeps the bugs away
Catch you around! ✌️
